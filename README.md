# CapstoneProject_with_Titanic_Survivor_Prediction

# Using Logistic Regression

--> In this challenge, you'll embark on an exciting journey to analyze the famous Titanic 
    dataset. Your mission is to build a logistic regression model that can predict whether a passenger survived the 
    tragic sinking of the Titanic based on various factors, such as age, sex, and fare.

--> Your adventure consists of the following tasks:

       * Explore the dataset
       * Clean the dataset
       * Prepare the dataset for logistic regression
       * Perform logistic regression
       * Evaluate the model
