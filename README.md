# CapstoneProject_with_Titanic_Survivor_Prediction

# Using Logistic Regression

--> In this challenge, you'll embark on an exciting journey to analyze the famous Titanic 
    dataset. Your mission is to build a logistic regression model that can predict whether a passenger survived the 
    tragic sinking of the Titanic based on various factors, such as age, sex, and fare.

--> Your adventure consists of the following tasks:

       * Explore the dataset
       * Clean the dataset
       * Prepare the dataset for logistic regression
       * Perform logistic regression
       * Evaluate the model



# --> Key Findings:

        (a) Most Influential Predictors:
        
               * Gender (sex_female): Females had much higher odds of survival.
                * Age: Older passengers had lower odds of survival.
                * Class (pclass_3): Third-class passengers faced a significant survival disadvantage.
        
        (b) Weaker Predictors:
        
                * Parents/Children Aboard: While it slightly reduced survival odds, the effect was not statistically significant.
                * Second Class (pclass_2): The survival disadvantage for second-class passengers was not statistically strong.
        
        (c) Practical Implications:
        
                * Gender, age, and class were key determinants of survival on the Titanic.
                * Fare (proxy for wealth/status) also played a role in survival probabilities.
